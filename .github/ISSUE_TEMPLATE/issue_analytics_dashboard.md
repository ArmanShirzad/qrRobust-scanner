# [FEATURE] Advanced Analytics Dashboard with Interactive Charts

## Description
Implement a comprehensive analytics dashboard with interactive charts and visualizations to provide users with detailed insights into their QR code performance.

## Use Case
Users need to understand how their QR codes are performing, including scan patterns, geographic distribution, device types, and temporal trends. This will help them optimize their QR code campaigns and make data-driven decisions.

## Implementation Ideas

### Frontend Components
- **Dashboard Overview**: Key metrics cards (total scans, unique scans, conversion rate)
- **Interactive Charts**: Line charts for scan trends, pie charts for device/browser distribution
- **Geographic Heatmap**: World map showing scan locations
- **Time Series Analysis**: Hourly, daily, weekly, monthly views
- **Export Functionality**: CSV/PDF export of analytics data

### Backend Enhancements
- **Analytics API**: New endpoints for aggregated data
- **Data Processing**: Background jobs for analytics calculations
- **Caching**: Redis caching for frequently accessed analytics
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for live analytics

### Technologies
- **Charts**: Recharts or Chart.js for visualizations
- **Maps**: React-Leaflet for geographic visualization
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for analytics calculations
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization
