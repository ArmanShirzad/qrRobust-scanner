# [FEATURE] API Rate Limiting and Subscription Tiers

## Description
Implement comprehensive API rate limiting with subscription tiers to monetize the platform and provide different service levels for users.

## Use Case
The platform needs to scale sustainably by offering different service tiers:
- **Free Tier**: Basic features with limited API calls
- **Pro Tier**: Enhanced features with higher limits
- **Business Tier**: Advanced features with custom limits
- **Enterprise Tier**: White-label solution with unlimited access

## Implementation Ideas

### Subscription Tiers
```python
TIERS = {
    "free": {
        "scans_per_month": 100,
        "api_calls_per_hour": 60,
        "qr_codes_limit": 10,
        "features": ["basic_scanning", "basic_generation"]
    },
    "pro": {
        "scans_per_month": 10000,
        "api_calls_per_hour": 1000,
        "qr_codes_limit": 1000,
        "features": ["analytics", "custom_designs", "bulk_generation"]
    },
    "business": {
        "scans_per_month": 50000,
        "api_calls_per_hour": 5000,
        "qr_codes_limit": 10000,
        "features": ["api_access", "webhooks", "team_collaboration"]
    },
    "enterprise": {
        "scans_per_month": -1,  # unlimited
        "api_calls_per_hour": -1,  # unlimited
        "qr_codes_limit": -1,  # unlimited
        "features": ["white_label", "custom_domain", "priority_support"]
    }
}
```

### Rate Limiting Implementation
- **Redis-based**: Token bucket algorithm for rate limiting
- **Middleware**: FastAPI middleware for request throttling
- **Usage Tracking**: Real-time usage monitoring and alerts
- **Billing Integration**: Stripe integration for subscription management

### API Enhancements
- **Usage Headers**: Include rate limit info in API responses
- **Upgrade Prompts**: Suggest tier upgrades when limits are reached
- **Usage Dashboard**: Real-time usage monitoring for users

## Priority
