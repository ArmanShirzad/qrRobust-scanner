# 🧹 GitHub Repository Maintenance Guide

## 📊 **Clean Branch Structure**

### **Current Branches:**
```bash
main                    # Default branch (archive/backup)
qr-scanner-v1          # QR Scanner app (deployed)
qr-designer-v2         # QR Designer app (ready for deployment)
```

### **Cleaned Up Branches:**
- ✅ **Deleted**: `deployer` → `qr-scanner-v1`
- ✅ **Deleted**: `enterprisescaler` → `qr-designer-v2`
- ✅ **Deleted**: `feature-update`, `feature/update`, `backup-*`
- ✅ **Renamed**: `master` → `main`

## 🎯 **Repository Maintenance Strategy**

### **Branch Naming Convention:**
```bash
# App branches
qr-scanner-v1          # Version 1 QR Scanner
qr-designer-v2         # Version 2 QR Designer

# Feature branches (when needed)
feature/qr-scanner-*   # Features for scanner
feature/qr-designer-*  # Features for designer

# Hotfix branches (when needed)
hotfix/qr-scanner-*    # Bug fixes for scanner
hotfix/qr-designer-*   # Bug fixes for designer
```

### **Development Workflow:**
```bash
# Working on QR Scanner (V1)
git checkout qr-scanner-v1
git checkout -b feature/qr-scanner-new-feature
# Make changes
git commit -m "QR Scanner: Add new feature"
git checkout qr-scanner-v1
git merge feature/qr-scanner-new-feature
git push origin qr-scanner-v1

# Working on QR Designer (V2)
git checkout qr-designer-v2
git checkout -b feature/qr-designer-new-feature
# Make changes
git commit -m "QR Designer: Add new feature"
git checkout qr-designer-v2
git merge feature/qr-designer-new-feature
git push origin qr-designer-v2
```
