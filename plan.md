### 1.2 Database Architecture
- PostgreSQL for production (Railway compatible)
- SQLAlchemy ORM with Alembic migrations
- Redis for caching and rate limiting

**Models:**
```python
User → id, email, password_hash, tier, created_at
QRScan → id, user_id, content, timestamp, metadata
QRCode → id, user_id, short_url, destination, analytics
Subscription → id, user_id, stripe_customer_id, tier
APIKey → id, user_id, key_hash, rate_limit
```
